            - As part of the Europa Clipper Flight Software Internal Test (FIT) team I designed, implemented, and maintained a set of integration tests that verified L5 requirements. These tests were written in Python and interfaced with spacecraft simulation environments (both software and hardware).
            - Worked closely with the module developers to design tests for Critical Relay Controllers (CRC), Event Reports (EVR), Communication Behaviors, and Radio configuration manager.
            - Developed and maintained tools for managing the tracking of verification items and their status for use in release reporting. 
            - Team liaison for Known Warning EVR Dispositions. Worked with other V&V teams to help disposition EVRs found in other venues.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
